# Shuttle

**Two-dimensional thinking for the modern mind.**

[wwwshuttle.app](https://wwwshuttle.app) — *weaving warp weft*

Shuttle is a Progressive Web App for exploring ideas both sequentially and associatively — like a weaving shuttle moving back and forth, creating connections that build fabric.

- **Horizontal (Threads)**: Sequential flow — narratives, timelines, chapters
- **Vertical (Depth Links)**: Conceptual connections — dive deeper, surface back
